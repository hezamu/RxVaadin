# Functional Reactive Programming with Vaadin

This is a quick proof of concept on how to build Vaadin user interfaces using the [functional reactive programming](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1030631/283077) approach. It uses the excellent [RxJava library](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava) from Netflix for Observables, and Java 8 is required for lambdas.

## Getting started

This repository includes a [demo application](https://github.com/hezamu/RxVaadin/tree/master/src/org/vaadin/hezamu/rx/demo) that tries to show the advantages of using the FRP approach with Vaadin.

If you want to run the demo yourself, just do a checkout and run it in a Java8 compliant servlet container. I wrote this in Eclipse Kepler and Jetty using the very nice [Run Jetty](http://code.google.com/p/run-jetty-run) plugin.

## Affliation

This is a weekend project of the author, not an official add-on by Vaadin Ltd.
